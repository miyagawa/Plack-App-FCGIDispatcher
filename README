NAME
    Plack::App::FCGIDispatcher - Dispatch requests to FCGI servers

SYNOPSIS
      # app.psgi
      use Plack::App::FCGIDispatcher;
      my $app = Plack::App::FCGIDispatcher->new({
          port => 8080, # FastCGI daemon port
      })->to_app;

DESCRIPTION
    Plack::App::FCGIDispatcher is a PSGI application to dispatch requests to
    external FastCGI servers listening on TCP or UNIX sockets.

    Since external FastCGI servers can be written in any language such as
    Ruby or PHP, this could be useful to route requests to Rails
    applications for instance from your Plack-based web server, or apply one
    of Plack middleware to PHP applications.

    See also Plack::App::Proxy which uses HTTP instead of FastCGI and has
    more configuration options.

CONFIGURATION
    host, port
          my $app = Plack::App::FCGIDispatcher->new({
              host => '127.0.0.1', port => 8080,
          })->to_app;

        Specifies host and port where FastCGI daemon is listening. host
        defaults to 127.0.0.1.

    socket
          my $app = Plack::App::FCGIDispatcher->new({
              socket => "/tmp/fcgi.sock",
          })->to_app;

        Specifies UNIX socket path where FastCGI daemon is listening.
